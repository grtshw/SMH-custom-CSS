SMH-custom-CSS
==============

Customised CSS for the SMH.com.au website to be used with Stylebot


To use you will need to have Stylebot installed for Chrome (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha). Once installed, browse to smh.com.au and view the Stylebot styles for that page (CTRL+M). You can then paste this CSS and enjoy a much less cluttered news resource.
